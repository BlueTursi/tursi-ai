# Tursi: AI Model Deployment Framework
## Product Requirements Document

# Overview
Tursi is an open-source framework designed to make AI model deployment as simple and efficient as possible, particularly for resource-constrained environments like IoT and Edge devices. Following the successful patterns established by Docker in containerization, Tursi aims to revolutionize AI model deployment with a familiar, user-friendly approach.

Vision Statement: "An open-source framework to compose and deploy AI models with ease"

Target Users:
- ML Engineers deploying models to production
- DevOps teams managing AI infrastructure
- IoT/Edge developers working with resource constraints
- Data Scientists needing simple deployment solutions

# Core Features

## 1. Core Engine (tursid)
- Daemon process managing model deployments
- Resource optimization and monitoring
- Model lifecycle management
- API server for client communication

## 2. Command Line Interface (tursi)
Primary Commands:
- tursi up: Deploy and start a model
- tursi down: Stop and clean up model deployment
- tursi ps: List running models
- tursi logs: View model logs
- tursi stats: Monitor resource usage

Advanced Features:
- Model quantization (4-bit/8-bit)
- Rate limiting
- Resource monitoring
- Health checks

## 3. Future Ecosystem Components
- TursiHub: Model registry and sharing platform
- Tursi Desktop: GUI for model management
- tursi-compose: Multi-model orchestration

# User Experience

## Primary User Flows

1. Basic Model Deployment:
```bash
# Deploy a model
tursi up distilbert-base-uncased

# Check status
tursi ps

# View logs
tursi logs

# Stop deployment
tursi down
```

2. Optimized Deployment:
```bash
# Deploy with optimization
tursi up bert-base-uncased --quantization static --bits 4

# Monitor resources
tursi stats
```

## User Personas

1. ML Engineer

- Uses: Core CLI, quantization features

2. DevOps Engineer
- Needs: Monitoring, resource management
- Uses: Stats, logs, health checks

3. Edge Developer
- Needs: Resource optimization, lightweight deployment
- Uses: Quantization, rate limiting

# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Health Checks and Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Add health check functionality and improve error handling across the system.
# Details:
Implement health check endpoints in the API server. Create automatic recovery mechanisms for models that crash. Improve error handling throughout the system with detailed error messages and logging. Add connectivity checks between CLI and daemon. Implement proper shutdown procedures for unexpected terminations.

# Test Strategy:
Test health checks by simulating various failure scenarios. Verify the system can recover from crashes. Test error messages are clear and helpful.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Server Health Checks and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add health check endpoints to the API server and implement comprehensive logging for error tracking
### Details:
Create a '/health' endpoint in the API server that checks and reports on system components status (database connectivity, model availability, etc.). Implement structured logging throughout the API server with different severity levels (info, warning, error, fatal). Add unique error codes and detailed error messages for all API responses. Set up log rotation and persistence. Ensure all API errors are properly caught, logged, and return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive messages.

## 2. Implement Model Recovery and CLI-Daemon Connectivity Checks [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create automatic recovery mechanisms for crashed models and implement connectivity verification between CLI and daemon
### Details:
Develop a watchdog system that monitors model processes and automatically restarts them if they crash. Implement graceful degradation when models are unavailable. Add health status reporting from models to the central health check system. For CLI-daemon communication, implement a heartbeat mechanism to verify connectivity. Add automatic reconnection logic in the CLI when the daemon connection is lost. Create clear error messaging for connection issues that guides users on troubleshooting steps.

## 3. Implement Graceful Shutdown and System-wide Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Add proper shutdown procedures for unexpected terminations and implement consistent error handling across all system components
### Details:
Implement signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT) in all components to ensure graceful shutdown. Create cleanup procedures that properly close connections, save state, and terminate child processes. Develop a system-wide error handling strategy with standardized error types and handling patterns. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies to prevent cascading failures. Add global exception handlers as a last resort for unexpected errors. Create a comprehensive system health dashboard that aggregates health information from all components. Test the system's resilience by simulating various failure scenarios.

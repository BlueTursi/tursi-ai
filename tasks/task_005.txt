# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Model Deployment Logic
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core functionality to deploy and run AI models.
# Details:
Implement the model deployment logic in the daemon. Use the Transformers library to load models from Hugging Face. Create a model manager class that handles loading models into memory, starting inference servers, and managing their lifecycle. Implement proper cleanup on shutdown. Support the basic model deployment flow as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test with small models like distilbert-base-uncased. Verify models can be loaded, run, and stopped correctly. Test memory usage and cleanup to ensure no leaks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ModelManager class structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the basic ModelManager class that will be responsible for model lifecycle management
### Details:
Create a ModelManager class with the following components: 1) Constructor that initializes necessary data structures for tracking loaded models and running inference servers, 2) Methods for model registration and validation, 3) Configuration handling for model parameters, 4) Error handling and logging infrastructure, 5) Interface methods that will be called by the daemon. Include documentation for each method and proper type hints. This class should follow a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance manages all models.

## 2. Implement model loading functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add methods to load models from Hugging Face using the Transformers library
### Details:
Extend the ModelManager to implement model loading functionality: 1) Create methods to download and cache models from Hugging Face, 2) Implement model loading with appropriate device placement (CPU/GPU/TPU), 3) Add support for different model types and architectures, 4) Implement memory management to handle model loading constraints, 5) Add progress tracking and error handling for the loading process. Use the Transformers library's pipeline and model loading capabilities, with appropriate handling of model configurations.

## 3. Implement inference server management and lifecycle hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add functionality to start, monitor, and shut down inference servers for loaded models
### Details:
Complete the ModelManager by implementing: 1) Methods to start inference servers for loaded models, 2) Health monitoring and status reporting for running servers, 3) Resource management to optimize performance, 4) Graceful shutdown procedures to ensure proper cleanup, 5) API endpoints for the daemon to interact with running models, 6) Implementation of the model deployment flow as specified in the PRD. Include proper exception handling for server failures and implement appropriate retry logic. Ensure that the lifecycle hooks properly clean up resources when models are unloaded or when the daemon shuts down.

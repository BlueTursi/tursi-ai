# Title: Create Comprehensive Documentation and Examples
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop detailed documentation and example usage patterns.
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation including installation instructions, command reference, and example usage patterns. Document all command-line options. Create examples for different user personas (ML Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Edge Developer). Include troubleshooting guides and performance optimization tips. Prepare README and contribution guidelines for the open-source project.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy and completeness. Test examples to ensure they work as described. Get feedback from potential users representing different personas.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Documentation Structure and Installation Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational documentation structure and detailed installation instructions
### Details:
Establish the documentation framework with proper organization. Create detailed installation guides covering all supported platforms and deployment scenarios.
